## Project description

### Listing Pokémon
Imagine that you found a lot of pokemons in your city. A friend of yours, who is a young child, would like to see them, but there are so many that is impossible to memorize their names. 
You, his best friend, decide to create a **Pokelist**, an app where a child can see the pokemons and get their names.

### Writing the Code
It should be simple, all you need to do is create a **React app** that lists Pokémon images on cards (one image and name). You can choose a layout, the colors, it is totally up to you. 

An inspiration ;-) https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp

All images have the name of the Pokémon.

### Delivery 1
Once you finished your code, you should:
- create a git repository (E.g. github) with a the name **Pokelist app**.
-  add a folder called **Delivery 1**
- add the files inside that folder
- commit the changes and push it.
- send us the link with the instructions to run the app.
